# COVID-19 Impact Project

This folder contains the specific application of the **Simple HIV Model** to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on HIV transmission in Australia. The model assesses changes in several time-sensitive factors such as sexual partners, condom use, HIV testing, PrEP use, and migration in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Project Description

The **COVID-19impact** project applies the Simple HIV Model to explore the dynamics of the HIV epidemic during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The model simulates three scenarios from December 2019 to August 2022. The first scenario is the “COVID-19 scenario”, where all changes in monthly parameter values occur and reflect the impact of COVID-19. The second scenario is the “no COVID-19 scenario”, a counterfactual scenario where the input parameters remained at their values in December 2019 and corresponded to pre-COVID-19 values. The third scenario is the “no COVID-19 plus PrEP scenario”, an alternative counterfactual no COVID-19 scenario where PrEP scale-up and the corresponding decrease in condom use prior to 2019 continued during 2020-2022, with the other parameters remaining at their December 2019 value.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have installed the following:

- **R** version 4.3.2 or higher
- **RStudio** (optional but recommended)
- Required R packages: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `gridExtra`, `RColorBrewer`, `stringr`, `tidyverse`, and `cowplot`

### Running the Model
1. **Set Up the Project**  
   Run `0_Setupmodel.Rmd` to create the project structure and copy template files. Update the template files in `data/` to reflect the specifics of the **COVID-19impact** project.

2. **Input Data and Run the Model**  
   Open and execute `1_input and run model.Rmd`. This script allows you to configure different scenarios and run the Simple HIV Model to generate results.

3. **Generate Figures**  
   Use `2_Generate_figures.Rmd` to create visualizations of the results. The script produces several figures to illustrate new HIV infections over time, annual diagnoses, and the effects of various scenarios.

## Output Data
The generated output files are stored in the `output/` folder. These include results for each scenario, with details like new HIV infections, diagnoses, and the total number of people living with HIV (PLHIV). Results also include 95% percentile intervals to capture uncertainty.

## Figures
All figures generated by the model are saved in the `figures/` folder, which provides visual summaries of key outputs like new HIV infections and annual diagnoses.

## Customization and Scenarios
The **COVID-19impact** project uses `GenerateScenarios.R` to define scenarios. You can modify this script to explore additional interventions or dynamics as needed for future studies.

## Disclaimer
The model has been made publicly available for transparency and replication purposes and in the hope it will be useful. We take no responsibility for results generated with the model and their interpretation but are happy to assist with its use and application.
